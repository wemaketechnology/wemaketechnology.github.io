                        We use a model based approach (Model Driven Software Development) in the development of applications. The best advantage of this approach is that it is mostly automated, and as a result, it reduces the development time and supports the industrialization of technology processes.

                        Our teams rely on the Scrum methodology to make our software development process more agile and light.

                        We  also provide a continuous delivery process. Application development, project support, training and support for the tools we create, are all part of the process too.

                    Eclipse and OSGI Technologies: Our selection

                        Eclipse is a platform that has been designed from the ground up for building integrated web and application development tooling. The platform has evolved a lot since its beginning and now it leads the way in rich client applications and is capturing the runtime and server worlds. The Equinox runtime, an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification, is one of the most important factors for the Eclipse success.

                    <p>
                        The value of the platform is what it encourages: rapid development of integrated features based on a plug-in model.

                        Our products and services follow the open-source business model and that is the reason the Eclipse platform is a natural choice for us. The Eclipse platform provides an enormous amount of tools ready to use, from application development tooling to model driven software. However, such freely available open-source tools may not cover all the user needs. That's when Make Technology services and products take place, providing customized and individual solutions, with the Eclipse Platform as the basis for the development of these solutions.
